Setup
- If you're seeing this, you've unpacked the unitypackage file into your project.
  - If you somehow didn't do that, do that first! You should be able to just drag
    and drop it in. Select everything from the package to import.
- Find "GCSLogo.scene", and add it as scene 0 in your build settings.
- Make sure that your main menu or first scene is set to be scene 1.
- Play the logo scene! If you see an animation, then your main menu, you're done!

Some Recommendations
- The default red version of the logo looks best on white.
- If you leave the camera background white, you might want to change the color
  of the unity logo splash and splash background to match! The black unity logo
  on white background fades very nicely into this.
