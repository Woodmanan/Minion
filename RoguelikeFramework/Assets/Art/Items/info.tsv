Wooden Buckler	Wooden Bucklers	The wooden buckler is a poor substitute for a shield when facing ranged weapons, but highly effective at deflecting swords and pummeling an opponent. Usually paired with a quick weapon such as a falchion, the wooden buckler is also helpful at obfuscating attacks by hiding the sword hand from view. Personally, I prefer the wooden buckler for a simple reason: Iâ€™m the laziest warrior in Uethyn.	0	3	COMMON	xfcavsyu	Wood shield layer (low priority)
Uethyn Short Sword	Short Swords	It is common knowledge that the pride of the Uethyn people was its army. Honed to perfection by the constant warfare with the sandwurms to the north, trolls to the south and orcs to the east, the Thousand were what every Uethyn boy dreamed to be. The secret to their success: the shortsword. The shortsword was perfect for the close range stabbing and slashing necessary for the infamous Shield Wall to work. Even in duels, underestimating the ease at which a Uethyn shortsword can slip inside your guard would often be your last mistake.	0	3	COMMON	gqebdaay	Sword Attack
Iron Shield	Iron Shields	The iron shield is sturdy and reliable, but nothing special. The Uethyn armies traditionally carried these for defense. They are common enough to have made it down here into this dungeon in non-insignificant amounts.	2	5	COMMON	jqrtjahp	Metal shield layer (low priority)
Ice Bow	Ice Bows	It is a common tale amongst the uneducated that there was local artificer's apprentice whose magical implements kept overheating long ago. Instead of learning how to improve their magical circuitry, they developed an engravement for absorbing all heat. Naturally, the second thing they did was weaponize this. Of course, this is false. The apprentice merely found the work of some faraway tribes in a hot desert, where this type of bow is very effective. Their origins matter less than their capabilities, really. The geniuses truly responsible for this created a weapon that would imbue basic arrows with effects as if someone had engraved the arrows themselves. They are impractical in cold places, but I doubt that will be a problem.	0	4	COMMON	ufpxllhc	Bow attack Ice layer (low priority)
Uethyn Helm	Uethyn Helms	Although impractical against the northern sandwurms and the southern trolls for obvious reasons, the Uethyn Helm was essential against the orcs, particularly as the war dragged on to its more desperate period. Lightly engraved on either side of the helm was a sword and a vine symbolizing their reality of war and their dream of peace. After the orcs broke through and enacted the massacre of Dravyn, helms were engraved with two swords - symbolizing their reality of war and their dream of revenge.	0	4	COMMON	gvfolbpj	
Flame Sword	Flame Swords	Every so often, some young, enterprising fool in the Academy decides that making a flaming sword would be a good idea. Almost as often, someone loses an arm. Setting yourself on fire is poor ettiquette, but setting your enemies on fire... Just remember to practice proper fire safety and you will not catch fire. Simple.	0	3	UNCOMMON	kivqywjr	Sword Attack Fire layer (low priority)
Recurve Bow	Recurve Bows	The recurve bow was devised long ago by hunters near the Spine as an alternative to the sling. Although bandits would often use them for ambushes, it took nearly a thousand years for armies to understand their power and the Age of Archery to start. With the right arrow, the recurve bow can shoot through two men with armor or the hide of a wild bear. And with enough of the right arrows, the recurve bow can shoot through two thousand men with armor and the hide of a thousand wild beasts.	0	4	COMMON	okgciysy	Bow attack
Basic Arrow	Basic Arrows	A bow without arrows is like a warrior without a weapon or a firepit without a fire: useless. 	0	4	COMMON		
Padded Armor	Padded Armor	Padded armor is one of the weakest types of armor known to man. First made by the hunters and trappers near the Spine by using the hides of conquered beasts, it was found to be effective against the claws and maws of their kin. Padded armor was quickly exported to the rest of the known world by using thick cloth in lieu of hides. Although padded armor is both cost effective and relatively lightweight, the best can only be found at its birthplace, the Spine.	0	4	COMMON	ohcvmwqa	
Scroll of Teleport	Scrolls of Teleport	The scroll of teleport was another incomplete success of the Academy wizards. Initially conceptualized by merchants who wanted a teleport gate to the Khera Heartlands, teleporting turned out to be nearly impossible with great distances. Blinking was initially used as the backbone of the spell, but the calculations required would have taken a thousand mathemagicians a thousand years. Then, someone smart thought of bending the world like a napkin. It worked at first, but before long any attempt at teleporting meant a good chance you were at the top of the Spine or the bottom of the Ambient Trench.	0	5	UNCOMMON		Teleport SFX
Scroll of Blinking	Scrolls of Blinking	Blinking was actually one of the spells that Archmage Mayhet devised to better play hide and seek with his visitors. In one moment he would welcome the mob of soldiers with a colorful fireball, then tap their commander on the shoulder with burning hands. He viewed it like a beautiful dance - weaving in and out of the ranks in moments to the beat of some diabolical song. The Academy's wizards were able to reconstruct the spell from the scant survivors' reports in scroll form, although the complete spell was beyond the Academy's ability.	0	5	UNCOMMON		Usage SFX?
Lesser Potion of Healing	Lesser Potions of Healing	Potions of healing are the bane of all assassins and old school tacticians. Brewed by the legendary alchemist Duvike after his son was killed in a street brawl, minor healing potions were quickly mass produced and became a staple of all armies and dungeon explorers. Since most lesser monsters do not understand how they work, they can often be found near the corpses of unfortunate souls that have departed this world or as a trophy in a monster cache.	0	4	UNCOMMON		Potion chug
Chainmail		It takes three straight days and nights with no rest to complete a single chain mail. For an army a thousand strong, it takes a generation of smiths and a fortune of metal to build up enough chainmail for every warrior. But in the undercity, they say it takes a single night and a sharp knife for an enterprising young man to earn a new set.	2	5	COMMON		
Key	Keys	Not all gates need to be lockpicked, nor all doors broken down. Sometimes, the easy way will suffice.	0	0	COMMON	bsqkfmtn
